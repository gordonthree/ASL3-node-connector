TARGET=29972 # This is the node you want to automatically connect to
IDLE_LIMIT=60  # seconds of idle time on ASL node before disconnect
AUDIO_PATH="/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom" # directory where the WAV files are stored (recommended you put them here)

EARLY_ANNOUNCE="10-min-generic-announcement" # Put your 10 minute warning announcement here

   # This is a dwell time so you connect after the announcement

   # and you will hear the announcement on both nodes, which is bad.
